-In prefabs folder, go to the Single_Slash folder, 7 single slash effects are in there that are also used in making of Combo_slash for Demo Scene along with Crack_ground.
 
- These effects are using 3D meshes, So you have to manually put them together to make a new combo or to use in your project.

- Besides that, its simple drag and drop and simple change of textures and some values can create a totally new effect in no time using these shaders.
